            The tuft of yellow feathers over the ear and white streak in front
            of the eye easily distinguishes this from all the other bulbuls.
            Females are distinguished from males by their slightly smaller size
            and broad yellow tail-tips. These birds reach 18.5 – 20 cm in
            length. Yellow-eared bulbuls are restricted to the higher hills,
            mostly above 1,700 meters altitude. They do descent to about 1,100
            meters on the western slopes, but are rarely seen below 1,200 meters
            on the eastern side of the central mountains. They also occur in the
            higher parts of the Knuckles Range and Sinharaja.
          </p>
          They are rather shy birds that generally keep to the forest and seen
          occasionally in gardens. The sharp whee, whee, whee call is
          unmistakable. They gather in large numbers, preferring to feed on
          berries among shrubs and in the mid-canopy. Yellow-eared Bulbuls breed
          throughout the year, with two peaks in March-May and August-October
          (the former being the major peak). An open, cup-shaped nest is built
          in a tree fork about 3-5 meters above the ground. The nest is
          constructed mostly from green moss, the cup being lined with fine
          ferns and rootlets. The speckled eggs which sometimes appear pinkish
          with reddish brown markings, measure around 23.4 x 16.7 mm.
          <p>
            Breeding takes place during two marked seasons; March to May, and
            August to September. Both birds excavate the nest chamber. The
            chamber entrance is usually 3 – 6 meters above the gr sometimes
            higher. The diameter of the entrance is about 25 cm, the chamber
            depth being .5 cm. No nesting materials are used, and up to three
            pure white eggs. Both parents participate in incubating the eggs and
            feeding the young.
