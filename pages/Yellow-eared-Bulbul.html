    <p>
      The tuft of yellow feathers over the ear and white streak in front of the
      eye easily distinguishes this from all the other bulbuls. Females are
      distinguished from males by their slightly smaller size and broad yellow
      tail-tips. These birds reach 18.5 – 20 cm in length. Yellow-eared bulbuls
      are restricted to the higher hills, mostly above 1,700 meters altitude.
      They do descent to about 1,100 meters on the western slopes, but are
      rarely seen below 1,200 meters on the eastern side of the central
      mountains. They also occur in the higher parts of the Knuckles Range and
      Sinharaja.
    </p>
    <P>
    They are rather shy birds that generally keep to the forest and seen
    occasionally in gardens. The sharp whee, whee, whee call is unmistakable.
    They gather in large numbers, preferring to feed on berries among shrubs and
    in the mid-canopy. Yellow-eared Bulbuls breed throughout the year, with two
    peaks in March-May and August-October (the former being the major peak). An
    open, cup-shaped nest is built in a tree fork about 3-5 meters above the
    ground. The nest is constructed mostly from green moss, the cup being lined
    with fine ferns and rootlets. The speckled eggs which sometimes appear
    pinkish with reddish brown markings, measure around 23.4 x 16.7 mm.
  </P>
    <p>
      Breeding takes place during two marked seasons; March to May, and August
      to September. Both birds excavate the nest chamber. The chamber entrance
      is usually 3 – 6 meters above the gr sometimes higher. The diameter of the
      entrance is about 25 cm, the chamber depth being .5 cm. No nesting
      materials are used, and up to three pure white eggs. Both parents
      participate in incubating the eggs and feeding the young.
