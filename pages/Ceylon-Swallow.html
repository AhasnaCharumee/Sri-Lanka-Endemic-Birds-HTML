            This bird has been recently recognized as a distinct species and
            added to the Sri Lankan endemic list. Sparrow sized and stockier
            than our other swallows, it is unmistakable with purple-blue glossed
            upperparts and rusty underparts and rump. Both sexes are alike.
            Young are duller.
          </p><P>
          The species is well distributed throughout the island up to about 1500
          metres elevation. The birds associate in pairs or more often in
          scattered groups and spend their time flying after the insect prey
          they feed on. The usual habitat is open areas such as paddy fields,
          roadsides, grasslands, grass covered hillsides etc. The flight is
          typical swallow type with the wings being open and shut at the wrist
          joint. The birds flutter the wings rapidly and then glide gracefully
          before fluttering the wings again. The flight is however not as fast
          as the other swallows’. This species commonly associates with other
          swallows as well as swifts. They fly high as well as within a few feet
          from ground level. When not flying the birds sit in an open perch like
          a bare twig or power cable and preen themselves. The call is a
          pleasant muffled t’lee easily recognized when once heard. The birds
          also utter a loud twitter accompanied by a shuffling of wings.

            The nest is made out of mud pellets and stuck to the underside of a
            disused flat roof, cave, bridge or culvert generally about three
            metres from ground level. It is a bottle gourd shaped structure with
            a long entrance on one side. The nest chamber is within the half
            dome and consists of feathers and fibre. Both sexes collect mud from
            the ground, mix with saliva and mould it to worm-cast like pellets
            and use these to build the nest. The two or three eggs are pure
            white in colour. The young continue to use the nest for roosting for
            sometime even after fully fledged. The adults too often use the same
            nest to breed again. The breeding season is generally from March to
            July but some birds nest again later in the year.
