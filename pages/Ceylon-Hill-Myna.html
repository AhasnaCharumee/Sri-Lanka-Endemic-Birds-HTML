      The Sri Lanka hill myna or Ceylon myna (Gracula ptilogenys) is a myna, a
      member of the starling family. This bird is endemic to Sri Lanka. This
      passerine is typically found in forest and cultivation. The Sri Lanka myna
      builds a nest in a hole. The normal clutch is two eggs.The Ceylon Hill
      Myna is easily recognizable due to its glossy black plumage with a
      purplish sheen. It has a bright orange-yellow beak and fleshy yellow
      wattles on the sides of its head, which give it a distinctive look. Its
      legs and feet are also yellow, contrasting sharply with its dark body. The
      eyes are dark with a piercing gaze, adding to its alert and curious
      expression.

    These 25 cm long birds have green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on
    the head and neck. There are large white wing patches, which are obvious in
    flight. The strong legs are bright yellow, and there are yellow wattles on
    the nape.This species is primarily found in wet-zone forests, particularly
    in the central and southwestern hills of Sri Lanka. It prefers dense,
    evergreen forests at elevations above 500 meters, where it lives high in the
    treetops. Due to deforestation, its habitat is becoming more fragmented,
    making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.

      The different shape and position of the wattles and the stouter orange-red
      bill distinguish this species from the southern hill myna, which also
      occurs in Sri Lankan forests. The sexes are similar in plumage, but can be
      distinguished by iris color, which is pale in females and dark in males.
      Juveniles have a duller bill and smaller wattles, and are less glossy
      overall.The Ceylon Hill Myna is an omnivore, feeding on fruits, berries,
      nectar, and small insects. It plays a significant role in seed dispersal,
      helping maintain the balance of forest ecosystems. These birds are usually
      seen in pairs or small flocks, moving energetically through the treetops
      while foraging. One of its most remarkable abilities is vocal mimicry. The
      Ceylon Hill Myna can imitate a wide range of sounds, including calls of
      other birds and even human speech if kept in captivity. In the wild, their
      calls are loud, clear, and varied, often resembling whistles, screeches,
      and musical notes.
