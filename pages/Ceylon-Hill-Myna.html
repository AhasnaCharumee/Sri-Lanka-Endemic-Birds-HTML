            The Sri Lanka hill myna or Ceylon myna (Gracula ptilogenys) is a
            myna, a member of the starling family. This bird is endemic to Sri
            Lanka. This passerine is typically found in forest and cultivation.
            The Sri Lanka myna builds a nest in a hole. The normal clutch is two
            eggs.
          </p>
          These 25 cm long birds have green-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged
          on the head and neck. There are large white wing patches, which are
          obvious in flight. The strong legs are bright yellow, and there are
          yellow wattles on the nape.
          <p>
            The different shape and position of the wattles and the stouter
            orange-red bill distinguish this species from the southern hill
            myna, which also occurs in Sri Lankan forests. The sexes are similar
            in plumage, but can be distinguished by iris color, which is pale in
            females and dark in males. Juveniles have a duller bill and smaller
            wattles, and are less glossy overall.
