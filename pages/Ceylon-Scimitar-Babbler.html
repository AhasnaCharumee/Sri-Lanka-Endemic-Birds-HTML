      The males and females look alike and measure around 22 cm. The long sickle
      shaped yellow bill, the habit of feeding by searching on the trunk of
      trees and the very characteristic call enable the birds to be identified
      easily.This species is primarily found in the montane and submontane
      forests of Sri Lanka, typically at higher elevations in the island’s
      central and southwestern regions. The Ceylon Scimitar-Babbler prefers
      dense, shady forests, where it thrives in areas with thick undergrowth.
      Key locations where this bird can be spotted include Horton Plains,
      Sinharaja Forest Reserve, and Knuckles Mountain Range.
    </p>
    The bird is found in all suitable humid tall forest patches in the island
    except in the north peninsular. Its present distribution is primarily
    restricted to this habitat preference. In the hill country the bird is seen
    in the estates with good tree cover, specially along river reservations.The
    Ceylon Scimitar-Babbler is primarily an insectivorous bird, foraging on the
    forest floor for insects, small invertebrates, and other arthropods. It uses
    its long, curved bill to probe through leaf litter and undergrowth in search
    of food. This bird is highly energetic and often travels in small groups,
    actively moving through dense vegetation. The Ceylon Scimitar-Babbler is
    known for its loud and complex calls, which are used for communication
    within its group. These calls can be heard echoing through the forests
    during the early morning and late evening.
    <p>
      They are regular members of mixed species feeding flocks of the wet zone.
      The call is often a duet, the male calling first followed almost
      immediately by the female. Thus, it is heard as a single call. They are
      known to breed from December to February. The nest is built from mosses,
      leaves etc. in to a bank, ledge, tree cavity, an open cup-shaped. 3-5
      white eggs are laid.The Ceylon Scimitar-Babbler is classified as Near
      Threatened (NT) due to habitat destruction and degradation. The loss of
      its natural forest habitats, primarily due to deforestation, illegal
      logging, and agricultural expansion, poses a significant threat to its
      population. Conservation efforts, such as protecting Sri Lanka’s
      rainforests and promoting sustainable land-use practices, are vital to
      ensure the survival of this unique bird species. With its distinctive
      scimitar-shaped bill, lively nature, and important ecological role as an
      insect predator, the Ceylon Scimitar-Babbler is one of Sri Lanka’s
      remarkable and highly valued bird species.
