            The males and females look alike and measure around 22 cm. The long
            sickle shaped yellow bill, the habit of feeding by searching on the
            trunk of trees and the very characteristic call enable the birds to
            be identified easily.
          </p>
          The bird is found in all suitable humid tall forest patches in the
          island except in the north peninsular. Its present distribution is
          primarily restricted to this habitat preference. In the hill country
          the bird is seen in the estates with good tree cover, specially along
          river reservations.
          <p>
            They are regular members of mixed species feeding flocks of the wet
            zone. The call is often a duet, the male calling first followed
            almost immediately by the female. Thus, it is heard as a single
            call. They are known to breed from December to February. The nest is
            built from mosses, leaves etc. in to a bank, ledge, tree cavity, an
            open cup-shaped. 3-5 white eggs are laid.
