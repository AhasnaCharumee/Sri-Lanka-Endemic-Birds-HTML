    <p>
      The white throat, short stout bill and white tips to the outer tail
      feathers serve to distinguish Legge’s White-throated Flowerpecker from
      other flowerpeckers. The males that measure up to 10.7 cm in length are
      distinctly larger than the females. This flowerpecker is essentially found
      in the southwestern lowland rainforests.
    </p>
    White-throated flowerpeckers prefer tall forests and mainly inhabit the
    highest reaches of the forest canopy. They descend close to the forest floor
    to feed on the fruits of Osbeckia (Sinhala: bowitiya) and the seeds of
    Freycinetia (Pandanaceae), at which times they may be approached closely;
    the fruit of the parasitic plant Dendrophthoe falcate is a particular
    favourite. These birds are known also to feed on insets and spiders.
    <p>
      The call is heard most frequently around midday from the treetops: a weak
      tze-tze-tze ests are found on 18 – 38 metres tall dipterocarp trees. The
      nest is small (11.4 cm long & 8.9 cm wide), pear-shaped structures
      suspended from branches. The nest material consists of soft substances
      such leaf buds and pieces of bark padded together with cobwebs. The
      entrance has a porch-like shelter. The nest is constructed by the female,
      who also incubates the eggs. Two eggs, white with spots and speckles of
      purplish brick red measuring15.4 x 11.2 mm, are laid.

      The Legge’s Flowerpecker is a tiny but essential part of Sri Lanka’s
      birdlife, known for its fast movements, high-pitched calls, and role in
      pollination. As an endemic species, it holds great significance in the
      country’s natural heritage. While it faces threats due to habitat loss,
      conservation efforts can help protect this delicate bird and its forest
      home. Whether flitting among flowers or feeding on mistletoe berries, this
      beautiful species continues to add life to Sri Lanka’s rich biodiversity.
