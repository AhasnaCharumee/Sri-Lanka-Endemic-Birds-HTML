    <p>
      A large bird, the greater flameback is 33cm in size. Sexes look closely
      alike except that in the male the crest is red while in the female it is
      black spotted with white. In the female the ear coverts are blacker than
      the male and the under tail coverts are blackish brown (it is white
      crossed by angular dark bars in the male).
    </p>
    <P>
    The bird is found in all habitats with good forest cover but not very
    abundant and common (rare). The presence is often noted by its distinct call
    (a trill) that it makes on flight. Plantations and home gardens are visited
    if close to a forest patch. The pair sticks together all the time. The
    breeding season is from October to March. The nest is in a tree cavity. 1 –
    3 white eggs are laid.
  </P>
    <p>
      The Dusky striped Squirrel as well as the Layard’s Squirrel often
      associates with these birds. Food consists of both animal and vegetable
      matter. The flight is weak and confined to short spells from one patch to
      another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Large, spectacular woodpecker with crimson upperparts, black-scaled pale
      underparts, and a crested head. Males have a red crest, females a black
      crest with fine white markings. Endemic to Sri Lanka. Typically in pairs,
      in the understory of forests and woodlands, where it regularly joins mixed
      species flocks; can also occasionally be found in disturbed areas or home
      gardens. Note the pale ivory colored bill, and lack of a prominent white
      eyebrow, unlike the similar Red-backed Flameback. Also note a distinctive
      elliptical marking on the face below the eye, which distinguishes this
      flameback from all other flamebacks on Sri Lanka. Frequently given call is
      a rapid, fast-paced, high-pitched trill, usually getting quieter and
      decelerating at the end. A fast-paced, descending drum is also given
      regularly; both the call and drum are different from that of the more
      common Red-backed Flameback.
