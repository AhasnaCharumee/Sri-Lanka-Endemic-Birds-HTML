            Shy and secretive, Sri Lanka spurfowl is more often heard than seen.
            Their cackling early morning choruses are striking and unmistakable.
            They are expert ventriloquists; what is more, the birds move while
            calling, making it even more difficult to track them down. They are
            essentially ground birds and the males tend to be territorial.
          </p>
          The birds are plump about the size of a half-grown domestic chicken
          and the males are darker- colored (almost black) and glossier than
          females, which are paler more brown than black.
          <p>
            generally have a pair of spurs on each leg, while the females have a
            single, smaller spur on each leg. Spurfos are” known to breed from
            around November until March-April and also during July-August.

            They build a small, well-concealed nest in a shallow excavation dug
            under a stone or bush, often lining it with a few dead leaves. Two
            uniformly whitish eggs (around 42×3 1 mm in size) are laid.
            Nestlings resemble adult females, but are somewhat paler, and have a
            brownish-red iris and a dusky red bill.
