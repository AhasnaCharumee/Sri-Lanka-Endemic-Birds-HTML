    <p>
      Shy and secretive, Sri Lanka spurfowl is more often heard than seen. Their
      cackling early morning choruses are striking and unmistakable. They are
      expert ventriloquists; what is more, the birds move while calling, making
      it even more difficult to track them down. They are essentially ground
      birds and the males tend to be territorial.
    </p>
    <P>
    The birds are plump about the size of a half-grown domestic chicken and the
    males are darker- colored (almost black) and glossier than females, which
    are paler more brown than black.Kitulgala, and Kanneliya. It prefers thick
    jungle terrain, often near rocky outcrops and dense undergrowth, where it
    can remain hidden from predators. Unlike many other bird species, it rarely
    flies and instead moves quickly on the ground, using its strong legs to
    navigate the forest floor.
  </P>
    <p>
      generally have a pair of spurs on each leg, while the females have a
      single, smaller spur on each leg. Spurfos are” known to breed from around
      November until March-April and also during July-August.Ceylon Spurfowls
      are extremely shy and tend to remain hidden for most of the day. They are
      usually found in pairs or small family groups and are known for their
      loud, cackling calls, which serve as communication between individuals.
      These birds are omnivorous, feeding on a diet that includes seeds, small
      insects, worms, and fallen fruits. They use their powerful claws to
      scratch the ground in search of food, much like junglefowl. Unlike many
      other ground-dwelling birds, they roost in trees at night, which helps
      protect them from predators such as snakes and mongooses.
    </p>
    <p>
      They build a small, well-concealed nest in a shallow excavation dug under
      a stone or bush, often lining it with a few dead leaves. Two uniformly
      whitish eggs (around 42×3 1 mm in size) are laid. Nestlings resemble adult
      females, but are somewhat paler, and have a brownish-red iris and a dusky
      red bill.The Ceylon Spurfowl is a remarkable bird that is uniquely adapted
      to Sri Lanka’s dense forests. Its secretive nature, distinctive calls, and
      strong survival instincts make it a fascinating species to study. However,
      due to ongoing habitat destruction, conservation efforts are essential to
      protect this bird from future decline. By preserving Sri Lanka’s
      rainforests, we can ensure that this beautiful and rare species continues
      to thrive for generations to come.
