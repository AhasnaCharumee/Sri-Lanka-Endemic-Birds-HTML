            A rarely-seen bird, the Sri Lanka Whistling Thrush (also known as
            the Arrenga) is exclusively resident in the mountains of the wet
            zone, at altitudes between about 1,200 and 2,100 meters. It occurs
            only in natural, undisturbed forest. It is a rare and rather shy
            bird, most often seen on the margins of a densely shaded stream. The
            male’s hissing srhee.. srhee.. call, as it flutters between bushes
            in the evening, is usually heard before the bird itself is seen.
            Females are even shyer than males, and rarely seen. The birds are
            crepuscular.
          </p>
          There is single breeding season, from January to May, during which a
          large nest is built of roots, twigs, leaves and moss, with a deep cup
          at its Centre. Up to two pale green eggs (30.8 x 21.8mm), faintly
          speckled in reddish-brown (especially at the broad end) are laid.
          <p>
            Short-tailed, thrushlike flycatcher. Male mostly dark blue, with
            bright blue shoulder, and dark bill. Female all rufous, with blue
            shoulder patch. Very secretive bird of the shady understory and
            ground, inside gullies within montane forest. Dark male resembles
            larger Indian Blackbird, although Whistling-Thrush is dark-billed,
            with a shorter tail. Female similar to other nondescript, brown
            songbirds, but uniform rufous coloration and blue shoulder patch
            identifies it from all others. Voice includes a high-pitched “sreee”
            and “si” notes, as well as a complex, rapid twittering song
            comprised of varied pitch, whistled notes.
