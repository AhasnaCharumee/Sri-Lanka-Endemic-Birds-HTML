      Between a mynah and a bulbul in size. Identified by its olive-brown upper
      parts, two rows of white spots on the median and greater wing coverts,
      characteristic markings on the face and inverted fan shaped black spots on
      the breast and flanks. Sexes are similar. Young have paler streaked upper
      parts and buff lower parts with coalescing spots. The characteristic
      facial pattern is present in the young but is more indistinct.

    This is a terrestrial species which feeds mostly on the ground in the
    typical thrush manner, turning over leaves vigorously. Birds are often met
    with in the mornings and evenings feeding along jungle trails. This thrush
    has a quaint habit of perching on slight elevations or twigs on the ground.
    The Spotted-winged Thrush is a beautiful songster, singing with a variety of
    human sounding rich whistling notes. It also utters a thin, high pitched
    call when alarmed or as a warning to its mate. Food consists of insects,
    worms etc but the bird probably feeds on berries as well.

      The eggs are generally two in number. The ground colour varies from pale
      cream-buff to pale grey-green, profusely covered with small spots,
      blotches and streaks of light reddish brown all over with some underlying
      markings of lavender-pink. Both birds probably incubate and feed the
      young.

      The Ceylon Scaly Thrush is a ground-dwelling bird, feeding mainly on
      insects, earthworms, and small invertebrates hidden in the leaf litter.
      Unlike many other thrushes, it does not often perch in trees but instead
      moves silently along the forest floor, searching for food. It is a
      solitary bird and remains extremely secretive, making it difficult to
      observe in the wild. Its call is a soft, high-pitched whistle, often heard
      early in the morning or late in the evening. This species is known for
      being motionless for long periods, relying on its camouflage to avoid
      predators.The Ceylon Scaly Thrush is classified as Vulnerable (VU) due to
      habitat loss caused by deforestation and human encroachment. Since it
      depends on undisturbed forest habitats, conservation efforts are crucial
      for its survival. Protecting Sri Lanka’s remaining rainforests is
      essential to ensure the future of this rare and beautiful species. With
      its unique scaly appearance, secretive nature, and remarkable adaptation
      to the forest floor, the Ceylon Scaly Thrush remains one of Sri Lanka’s
      most mysterious and fascinating birds.
