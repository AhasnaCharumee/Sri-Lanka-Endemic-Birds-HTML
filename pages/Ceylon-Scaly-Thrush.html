            Between a mynah and a bulbul in size. Identified by its olive-brown
            upper parts, two rows of white spots on the median and greater wing
            coverts, characteristic markings on the face and inverted fan shaped
            black spots on the breast and flanks. Sexes are similar. Young have
            paler streaked upper parts and buff lower parts with coalescing
            spots. The characteristic facial pattern is present in the young but
            is more indistinct.

          This is a terrestrial species which feeds mostly on the ground in the
          typical thrush manner, turning over leaves vigorously. Birds are often
          met with in the mornings and evenings feeding along jungle trails.
          This thrush has a quaint habit of perching on slight elevations or
          twigs on the ground. The Spotted-winged Thrush is a beautiful
          songster, singing with a variety of human sounding rich whistling
          notes. It also utters a thin, high pitched call when alarmed or as a
          warning to its mate. Food consists of insects, worms etc but the bird
          probably feeds on berries as well.
          <p>
            The eggs are generally two in number. The ground colour varies from
            pale cream-buff to pale grey-green, profusely covered with small
            spots, blotches and streaks of light reddish brown all over with
            some underlying markings of lavender-pink. Both birds probably
            incubate and feed the young.
