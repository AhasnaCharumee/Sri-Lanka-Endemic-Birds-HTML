      Muscicapidae. It was previously included in the genus Muscicapa. This
      species is an endemic resident breeder in the hills of central Sri Lanka.
      The dull-blue flycatcher breeds in deciduous mountain forest, invariably
      above 600m, although it is not common below 900m. The main breeding season
      is in March and April, but a second brood is often reared later in the
      year.
    </p>
    The cup-shaped nest is a lined compact mass of moss. The site is usually a
    well-shaded rock ledge. The normal clutch is two or three brown-spotted pink
    eggs are laid.This species is 15 cm long. It is similar in shape to the
    spotted flycatcher and has a loud melodic song..
    <p>
      Adults are ashy blue, with a whitish belly. There is a black patch between
      the broad black bill and the eye, bordered with brighter blue above and
      below. Sexes are similar, but females are slightly duller.

      Juvenile dull-blue flycatchers are brown, heavily spotted on the head,
      back, wing-coverts and breast with pale buff; their flight feathers are
      broadly edged with blue-grey. This is relatively easy bird to see, despite
      its forest habitat. It feeds mainly on flying insects, beetles,
      caterpillars and other insects, but also eats berries.
