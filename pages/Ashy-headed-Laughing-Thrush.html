      The ashy-headed laughingthrush is a rangy bird, 23 centimetre (9 in) in
      length with a long floppy tail. It is rufous brown above and deep buff
      below, with a grey head and white throat. Like other babblers, these are
      noisy birds, and the characteristic laughing calls are often the best
      indication that they are present, since they are often difficult to see in
      their preferred habitat.
    </p>
    The ashy-headed laughingthrush is a resident breeding bird endemic to Sri
    Lanka. Its habitat is rainforest, and it is seldom seen away from deep
    jungle or dense bamboo thickets in the wet zone.
    <p>
      This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded
      wings and a weak flight.Although its habitat is under threat, this
      laughingthrush occurs in all the forests of the wet zone, and is quite
      common at prime sites like Kitulgala and Sinharaja. It builds its nest in
      a bush, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is three
      or four eggs.

    <p>
      Medium-sized, rufous babbler with a gray hood, beady pale eye, buff throat
      patch, and blackish bill and legs. Gregarious, usually encountered within
      small groups low in the understory, or on the ground, in wet forests of
      the lowlands and foothills. Can join mixed species flocks. Mixture of gray
      head, black bill and legs, and paler buff underside identify it from all
      other babblers on Sri Lanka. Variety of untidy vocalizations given,
      including scratchy notes, whistles, squeals, metallic “churrs” and
      “chirps”, and chattering calls, all given in combination.
