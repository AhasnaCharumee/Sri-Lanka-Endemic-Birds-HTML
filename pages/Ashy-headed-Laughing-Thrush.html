      <p>
        The Ashy-Headed Laughingthrush is a rare and fascinating bird species
        endemic to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Leiothrichidae family and is
        well known for its sociable nature and unique laughing calls. This
        species is mainly found in lowland and submontane rainforests, where it
        thrives in dense undergrowth and bamboo thickets. It is often seen in
        small flocks, moving actively through the foliage while foraging for
        food.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ashy-Headed Laughingthrush is a medium-sized bird, measuring
        approximately 22–25 cm in length. It has a distinct ashy-gray head,
        which contrasts with its olive-brown upperparts and paler underparts. A
        dark eye-stripe runs from the base of its curved, strong beak to the
        sides of its head, giving it a striking appearance. Its long, slightly
        graduated tail helps it maintain balance while hopping between
        branches..
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ashy-Headed Laughingthrush is omnivorous, feeding on a variety of
        insects, small fruits, berries, and seeds. It often forages on the
        forest floor, flipping leaves and twigs to find hidden prey.
        Occasionally, it follows mixed-species feeding flocks, joining other
        birds in search of food. This species is primarily found in the
        southwestern and central regions of Sri Lanka, including well-known
        rainforest reserves such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sinharaja Forest Reserve</li>
        <li>Kitulgala Rainforest</li>
        <li>Morapitiya Forest</li>
        <li>Kanneliya Forest Reserve</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Ashy-Headed Laughingthrush prefers dense forests with thick
        undergrowth, often near water sources. It thrives in humid environments
        and is less commonly seen in secondary forests or human-modified
        landscapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This bird is highly social, moving in groups of 6–10 individuals. It is
        extremely vocal, producing a variety of chattering, whistling, and
        laughing-like calls, which help the flock communicate while foraging.
        The bird's call is one of the most recognizable sounds in Sri Lanka’s
        rainforests. Although it is an active flier, the Ashy-Headed
        Laughingthrush prefers to move by hopping between branches and
        undergrowth. It is often seen playing, preening each other, and engaging
        in cooperative behaviors within its flock.

      </p>
      <p>
        Due to deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and climate change, the
        Ashy-Headed Laughingthrush is classified as Near Threatened (NT) on the
        IUCN Red List. The biggest threat to its survival is the destruction of
        Sri Lanka’s rainforests for agriculture, logging, and human settlements.
        Several conservation programs focus on protecting Sinharaja and other
        rainforests, which are crucial for the survival of this species.
        Strengthening these conservation efforts is essential to ensure that the
        Ashy-Headed Laughingthrush continues to thrive in the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ashy-Headed Laughingthrush is an important symbol of Sri Lanka’s
        rich avian biodiversity. Its fascinating social behavior, unique calls,
        and dependence on dense rainforests make it a treasured species among
        birdwatchers and conservationists. Preserving its natural habitat is
        critical for ensuring that future generations can continue to admire
        this remarkable bird.
