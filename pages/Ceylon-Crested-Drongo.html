      About 30 cm, this glossy black bird is common in the remaining low country
      wet zone forests. The prominent crest and long tail feathers separate them
      from the other Drongos in the area. They are a “nuclear” member of the
      mixed species feeding flocks of the low country wet zone. Playing the role
      of a “sentinel” species, it is often heard through the forest canopy.
    </p>
    <P>
    The nest is built on an open branch attached to it with mosses and lichens.
    The shallow cup holds around 2-3 eggs. The hatchlings stay stiff in the nest
    well camouflaged, even though the nest is exposed. The parent birds defend
    the nest and nestlings very well.
  </P>
    <p>
      The different shape and position of the wattles and the stouter orange-red
      bill distinguish this species from the southern hill myna, which also
      occurs in Sri Lankan forests. The sexes are similar in plumage, but can be
      distinguished by iris color, which is pale in females and dark in males.
      Juveniles have a duller bill and smaller wattles, and are less glossy
      overall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This species is highly active and often follows groups of monkeys or other
      animals, taking advantage of the insects that get disturbed by their
      movement. The Sri Lanka Crested Drongo is also known for its aggressive
      behavior when defending its territory, often chasing away much larger
      birds. Its diet mainly consists of insects, small reptiles, and even
      nectar from certain flowers. With its striking red eyes, this bird stands
      out against the green forest backdrop. It uses its strong beak to catch
      flying insects mid-air, showcasing its impressive hunting skills. The
      species plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by controlling insect
      populations and contributing to seed dispersal. Unfortunately,
      deforestation and habitat destruction pose a threat to the Sri Lanka
      Crested Drongo. As a forest-dependent species, the loss of natural
      habitats can significantly impact its survival. Conservation efforts are
      necessary to preserve Sri Lanka’s biodiversity and ensure that unique
      species like the Crested Drongo continue to thrive in their natural
      environment.
