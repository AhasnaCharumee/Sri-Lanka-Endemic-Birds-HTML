            About 30 cm, this glossy black bird is common in the remaining low
            country wet zone forests. The prominent crest and long tail feathers
            separate them from the other Drongos in the area. They are a
            “nuclear” member of the mixed species feeding flocks of the low
            country wet zone. Playing the role of a “sentinel” species, it is
            often heard through the forest canopy.
          </p>
          The nest is built on an open branch attached to it with mosses and
          lichens. The shallow cup holds around 2-3 eggs. The hatchlings stay
          stiff in the nest well camouflaged, even though the nest is exposed.
          The parent birds defend the nest and nestlings very well.
          <p>
            The different shape and position of the wattles and the stouter
            orange-red bill distinguish this species from the southern hill
            myna, which also occurs in Sri Lankan forests. The sexes are similar
            in plumage, but can be distinguished by iris color, which is pale in
            females and dark in males. Juveniles have a duller bill and smaller
            wattles, and are less glossy overall.
