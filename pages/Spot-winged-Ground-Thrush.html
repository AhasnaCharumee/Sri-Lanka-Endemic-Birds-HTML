            It is an endemic resident breeder in Sri Lanka. This uncommon
            species breeds in hill rainforests, and to a lesser extent in drier
            woodlands, at altitudes between 500 and 2000 m. The wintering areas
            are similar but include less well-wooded areas, and are generally at
            750 to 1500 m altitude. The spot-winged thrush is generally solitary
            and can be quite secretive, especially in the dense undergrowth and
            bamboo clumps it favours. Spot-winged thrushes are omnivorous, but
            eat far more insects than fruit. They feed on the ground.

          Adults of this medium-sized thrush, which measures 21 to 27 cm (8.3 to
          10.6 in) in total length and weighs 70 g (2.5 oz) are light brown
          above with a double wing bar of white spots. The pale face has two
          dark bars. The underparts are white with heavy spotting. The bill is
          black and legs are yellow. The song is a rich and varied whistling.
          <p>
            Brown thrush with bold dark spots on the underparts, white spots in
            the wings, and black facial stripes below the eye. Occurs in pairs
            or singly, on or near the ground, in forest, forest edge, and
            gardens, mostly in the Wet Zone, but also locally in the Dry Zone.
            No other thrush on Sri Lanka shows distinct rows of white spots on
            the wings, and bold spotting below. Gives very high-pitched
            “sweeeee” call; song is a highly variable collection of rich, rising
            and falling, melodious whistles and warbles.
