    <p>
      It is an endemic resident breeder in Sri Lanka. This uncommon species
      breeds in hill rainforests, and to a lesser extent in drier woodlands, at
      altitudes between 500 and 2000 m. The wintering areas are similar but
      include less well-wooded areas, and are generally at 750 to 1500 m
      altitude. The spot-winged thrush is generally solitary and can be quite
      secretive, especially in the dense undergrowth and bamboo clumps it
      favours. Spot-winged thrushes are omnivorous, but eat far more insects
      than fruit. They feed on the ground.
    </p>
    <P>
    Adults of this medium-sized thrush, which measures 21 to 27 cm (8.3 to 10.6
    in) in total length and weighs 70 g (2.5 oz) are light brown above with a
    double wing bar of white spots. The pale face has two dark bars. The
    underparts are white with heavy spotting. The bill is black and legs are
    yellow. The song is a rich and varied whistling.</P>
    <p>
      Brown thrush with bold dark spots on the underparts, white spots in the
      wings, and black facial stripes below the eye. Occurs in pairs or singly,
      on or near the ground, in forest, forest edge, and gardens, mostly in the
      Wet Zone, but also locally in the Dry Zone. No other thrush on Sri Lanka
      shows distinct rows of white spots on the wings, and bold spotting below.
      Gives very high-pitched “sweeeee” call; song is a highly variable
      collection of rich, rising and falling, melodious whistles and warbles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spot-winged Ground-Thrush is a rare and fascinating bird, known for
      its melodious song, secretive behavior, and dependence on Sri Lanka’s
      dense forests. Its preference for deep forest cover and leaf litter makes
      it difficult to observe, but those who hear its song in the early mornings
      get a glimpse into the hidden beauty of Sri Lanka’s avian diversity.
      Conservation efforts focused on protecting rainforests and curbing
      deforestation are essential for ensuring the survival of this unique
      endemic species for future generations.
