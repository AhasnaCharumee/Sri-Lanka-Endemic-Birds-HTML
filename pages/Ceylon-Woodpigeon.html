            About the size of the domestic pigeon, but with a long tail. Sexes
            alike. Young birds are duller, and have only a trace of he black and
            white 'chess board' patch on the side of the neck.
          </p>
          Exclusively a forest dweller, It lives in pairs though small flocks
          will form where food is abundant. It is strictly arboreal, feeding on
          a variety of small jungle fruits and berries, among which the fruits
          of the wild cinnamon are much liked.
          <p>
            The breeding season is from February to May, and again from August
            to October. The nest is the usual pigeon-type, scanty platform of
            twigs; it is placed among foliage and twiggery in the canopy of a
            forest tree, or in the top of a tall sapling, usually at height of
            fifteen to twenty feet. The single, white egg measures about 38.5 X
            28.2 mm.

            This handsome pigeon is confined to the hill forest of Sri Lanka,
            though it has a close relation (the Nilgiri Wood Pigeon), of very
            similar appearance and habits, in the hills of South India. It s
            normal range is from 3,000 feet upwards to the highest elevations,
            but it wanders about a great deal and sometimes descends as low as
            1000 feet in the damp forests of the wet zone.
