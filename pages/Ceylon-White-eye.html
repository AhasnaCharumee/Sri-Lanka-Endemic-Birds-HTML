      This bird is slightly larger than the Indian white-eye (about 11 cm long)
      which it replaces above 4000 ft. The upper parts of the body and sides of
      neck are dark olive-green. The rump appears paler green while the crown
      and forehead appear darker. The wings and tail are brown edged with green
      on the back. The typical ring of tiny white feathers around the eye is
      present.

    The lores are dark and there is a dark streak below the eye. The chin,
    throat and upper breast are greenish-yellow as are the thighs and vent. The
    belly region is greyish white. The dark bill has a slaty base to the lower
    mandible. The legs are dark. The iris is yellow to reddish-brown.The Sri
    Lanka White-eye is omnivorous, meaning it eats a variety of foods. Its diet
    mainly consists of small insects, spiders, fruits, and nectar. It plays an
    important role in the ecosystem by helping control insect populations and
    acting as a pollinator for various flowering plants. These birds are often
    seen feeding on flower nectar, using their specialized beaks to extract it.
    They are also attracted to ripe fruits and sometimes visit gardens in search
    of food.

      This species can be distinguished from the widespread Indian white-eye,
      Zosterops palpebrosus, by its larger size, duller green back and more
      extensive yellow on the breast. It has a darker patch between the eye and
      the bill.The Sri Lanka White-eye is currently classified as a Least
      Concern (LC) species by the IUCN, as it is widely distributed across Sri
      Lanka’s central highlands. However, habitat destruction due to
      deforestation, climate change, and human encroachment could pose future
      threats. Conservation of montane forests is crucial to ensure the
      continued survival of this species.
