            This bird is slightly larger than the Indian white-eye (about 11 cm
            long) which it replaces above 4000 ft. The upper parts of the body
            and sides of neck are dark olive-green. The rump appears paler green
            while the crown and forehead appear darker. The wings and tail are
            brown edged with green on the back. The typical ring of tiny white
            feathers around the eye is present.
          </p>
          The lores are dark and there is a dark streak below the eye. The chin,
          throat and upper breast are greenish-yellow as are the thighs and
          vent. The belly region is greyish white. The dark bill has a slaty
          base to the lower mandible. The legs are dark. The iris is yellow to
          reddish-brown.
          <p>
            This species can be distinguished from the widespread Indian
            white-eye, Zosterops palpebrosus, by its larger size, duller green
            back and more extensive yellow on the breast. It has a darker patch
            between the eye and the bill.
