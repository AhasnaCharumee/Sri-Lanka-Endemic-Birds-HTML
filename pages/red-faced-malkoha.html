            Large, spectacular malkoha of moist lowland and mid-hill forest.
            Unmistakable with bright red face, yellowish bill, white belly and
            long, white-tipped tail. Found in the dense canopy of tall trees
            where it feeds on insects and small vertebrates. Normally found in
            pairs and often associates with mixed flocks usually led by
            Orange-billed Babblers. It can be hard to see despite its flashy
            appearance.
            <p>Usually silent but does soft clucking and a call like static
            noise. There are three species of Malkoha’s in Sri Lanka: the Blue
            faced Malkoha, the Sirkeer Malkoha and the Red-faced Malkoha. The
            Red-faced Malkoha is endemic to Sri Lanka; however, there are
            anecdotal reports of this species occurring in the Western Ghats.
            This is yet to be justified with solid evidence.</p>
            It is endemic to Sri Lanka although some old records have apparently
            erroneously referred to its presence in southern India.According to
            Baker (1934), it is found in the 'South of Travancore, where it was
            obtained by Stewart together with its nests'. <br />Later, Biddulph
            reported a red-faced malkoha in Madurai district, southern Tamil
            Nadu. Thilo Hoffmann later pointed out that this record would not
            stand up to a modern records committee, and it is now best
            disregarded.
