      This bird about 25cm in size is quite common in the low country and
      foothills. The maroon upper wing colours separate it from the
      Orange-Breasted Green Pigeon. The females appear similar but the middle
      tail feathers are yellowish green (it is bluish in the Orange-breasted
      Green Pigeon). As these are always associated with the male bird, the
      separation is easy to observe. The birds come to fruiting trees in large
      numbers, and call “coo” in a very distinct manner often indicating its
      presence even if not visible among the vegetation canopy. As of all
      pigeons, the nest is very flimsy with a few sticks put together. The
      nesting season is from December to June. Small white eggs are laid. The
      chicks are brought up on “pigeon milk”.

      This pigeon is primarily found in lowland rainforests, dry zone forests,
      and well-wooded areas across Sri Lanka. It prefers tall trees and dense
      foliage, making it difficult to spot despite its bright colors.The Ceylon
      Green Pigeon is a frugivorous bird, meaning it primarily eats fruits and
      berries. It plays an essential role in the ecosystem by dispersing seeds,
      helping maintain forest biodiversity. These birds are usually seen in
      small flocks, foraging for food in treetops. They have a soft, melodic
      call that can often be heard in forested areas.While the Ceylon Green
      Pigeon is not currently endangered, habitat loss due to deforestation
      poses a threat to its population. Conservation efforts to protect Sri
      Lanka’s forests are crucial to ensuring the survival of this stunning
      species. With its graceful movements, vibrant colors, and essential role
      in nature, the Ceylon Green Pigeon is a true treasure of Sri Lanka’s
      wildlife.
