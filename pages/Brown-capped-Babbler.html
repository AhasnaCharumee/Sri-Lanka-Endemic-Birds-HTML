      The Sri Lanka bush warbler is an elusive bird that confines itself mostly
      to dense undergrowth in forested areas. It is essentially a mountain
      species, rarely occurring below 1,500 metres altitude in the central
      hills. They move about in pairs or small groups of three or four
      individuals. Their food consists of insects and seeds, picked both from
      shrubs and the ground.
    </p>
    They can easily be separated from the other species by its overall
    dark-brown colour, its dark grayish breast and the faint light stripe that
    runs across its eye. Young males have a pale, reddish-yellow iris, which is
    white in young females. A small bird is 16 – 16.5 cm in length.
    <p>
      The breeding season appears to be from mid-March to about the end of May,
      with a Second season from about mid-August to end September. The nest is
      located close to the ground, often beside an opening or footpath. The nest
      is placed on top of a s concealed among the foliage. It has an open cup
      shape. Two pale-pink eggs (21.7 x 26.1 mm) covered with fine, purple-brown
      specks coalescing at the larger end, are laid.
