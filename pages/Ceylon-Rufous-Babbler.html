    <p>
      The Ceylon Rufous Babbler is an inhabitant of the wet zone forests and wet
      hills up to the highest elevations from almost sea level to the Horton
      plains. It is often also seen in adjoining home gardens and groves.
      Similar in size and form to the familiar Common Babbler, it is much more
      attractive than that species with its red-brown plumage and orange beak
      and legs. Within its forest habitat it is not uncommon, being a nucleus
      species of mixed feeding flocks.

    Within its forest habitat it is not uncommon, being a nucleus species of
    mixed feeding flocks. Like the Common Babbler, it moves in flocks. The
    flocks sometimes are very large. It occupies all levels of the forest, from
    canopy to the forest floor. The arrival of a flock is heralded by loud,
    squeaking calls. After a flock arrives making these high pitched calls, the
    birds continue to utter rather lower pitched squeaking calls while feeding.
    If any danger is sensed they resort to their high pitched loud calls again.
  </p>
    <p>
      The Dusky striped Squirrel as well as the Layard’s Squirrel often
      associates with these birds. Food consists of both animal and vegetable
      matter. The flight is weak and confined to short spells from one patch to
      another. The birds hop about energetically however, and while searching
      for food amongst foliage assume many acrobatic poses. Occasionally during
      the hot afternoons a troop can be seen to stay comparatively inactive,
      preening themselves or each other.
