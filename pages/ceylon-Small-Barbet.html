            Slightly larger than a sparrow. Sexes alike. The bright green upper
            parts, orange-yellow-face and throat-patches, and very small scarlet
            breast-spot, distinguish it from the Crimson-breasted Barbet.Usually
            located by incessant calls, given from the treetops. Occurs in open
            wooded areas, gardens, forest and forest edge in the lowlands and
            foothills, where typically encountered as singles or pairs. Most
            abundant in the wet zone, but occurs locally in the dry zone.
            Separated from Yellow-fronted Barbet by smaller size and red
            forehead, and from Coppersmith Barbet in lacking streaks below. Song
            is an incessant “pop-pop-pop-pop…”, while faster call notes are also
            given, “opopopopop”.
