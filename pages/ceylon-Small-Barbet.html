      Slightly larger than a sparrow. Sexes alike. The bright green upper parts,
      orange-yellow-face and throat-patches, and very small scarlet breast-spot,
      distinguish it from the Crimson-breasted Barbet.Usually located by
      incessant calls, given from the treetops. Occurs in open wooded areas,
      gardens, forest and forest edge in the lowlands and foothills, where
      typically encountered as singles or pairs. Most abundant in the wet zone,
      but occurs locally in the dry zone. Separated from Yellow-fronted Barbet
      by smaller size and red forehead, and from Coppersmith Barbet in lacking
      streaks below. Song is an incessant “pop-pop-pop-pop…”, while faster call
      notes are also given, “opopopopop”.

      This species is primarily found in the lowland forests and dry-zone
      forests of Sri Lanka, especially in the central and southern regions of
      the island. It thrives in dense tree cover and is typically seen in areas
      with sparse understory vegetation, where it can easily forage for fruits.
      The Ceylon Small Barbet is often found in well-wooded areas like home
      gardens, forests near rivers, and sometimes even in cultivated lands with
      nearby trees.The Ceylon Small Barbet is frugivorous, primarily feeding on
      a diet of fruits, berries, and seeds. It is often seen foraging on tree
      branches, using its strong beak to peck at fruits and insects. In addition
      to fruits, it also feeds on small insects and nectar, adding variety to
      its diet. These birds are typically seen in pairs or small groups, and
      they are highly active and noisy. They communicate through loud,
      repetitive calls that are a distinctive feature of the species. The Ceylon
      Small Barbet is known for its ability to drill holes in trees to create
      nests. It typically nests in cavities in large trees, and during the
      breeding season, it can often be heard calling loudly in its territory.

      Currently, the Ceylon Small Barbet is classified as Least Concern (LC) by
      the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Despite its
      relatively stable population, the species faces threats from habitat loss
      due to deforestation and land conversion for agriculture.
