            The Sri Lanka bush warbler has sometimes been placed in the genus
            Bradypterus and a 2018 study confirms that it is a sister to the
            clade that contains the Bradypterus and Megalurus warblers;[2] it
            appears to be closely related to that genus, but differs in
            structure (relatively shorter-tailed and longer-billed), plumage
            (unmarked) and song. It is monotypic.[3] The species is named after
            the collector Captain Edward Palliser (1826-1907). Edward and his
            brother Fred Palliser were both collectors in Sri Lanka. The species
            was described by Kelaart but published by Edward Blyth in 1851.[4]

          This is a medium-large warbler at 14 cm. The adult has a plain brown
          back, pale grey underparts, a broad tail and short wings. There is a
          weak supercilium, and the throat is tinged orange. The sexes are
          identical, as with most warblers, but young birds lack the throat
          colouration.
          <p>
            Small, nondescript, earthy-brown colored bird, with a graduated
            tail. Note particularly rich, buffy throat, short, indistinct grey
            eyebrow, and pale iris. Very secretive, singly or in pairs, within
            wet vegetation in understory of wet forests in the hills and
            mountains of Sri Lanka, on or near the ground. Uniform appearance,
            with buff throat and inconspicuous gray eyebrow separate this
            species from all other small brown birds in its limited range. Short
            song a musical “chiwee-chiwee-chiwee”. Calls include a short, sharp
            “wit” and a wet “chip” note.
